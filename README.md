# LGRP
This code is implementation of  "Local Gabor Rank Pattern (LGRP): A novel descriptor for face representation and recognition," in 7th IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS), 2015'

This version of code provides computaion of LGRP codes using fixed 4 neighbouhood pixels and 1 center pixel.
The multiscale verion will be uploaded soon.

Please remember to cite following reference [1] if you make use of this code in any publication.
