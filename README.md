# LGRP
This code is implementation of  "Local Gabor Rank Pattern (LGRP): A novel descriptor for face representation and recognition," in 7th IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS), 2015'

This version of code provides computaion of LGRP codes using fixed 4 neighbouhood pixels and 1 center pixel.
The multiscale verion will be uploaded soon.

#### How to use this code
  >> [out, VR]= LGRP(imagefile)
  The out provides the LGRP encoded feature map. VR provides the variance measure for the LGRP code
